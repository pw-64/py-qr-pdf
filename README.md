# pyqr-pdf

Thank you to https://github.com/shivamsoods/raymond-python for which I based this off of.
I was tasked with batch creating qr codes with extra textual information, so improved upon [@shivamsoods](https://github.com/shivamsoods) fpdf implementation to do the task for me, rather than create them manually in MS Word.
